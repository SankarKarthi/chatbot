# chatbot

The code is a simple chatbot that acts as a basic calculator. The chatbot interacts with the user by taking input from them, processing it, and providing a response based on the input.

The chatbot is implemented in Python and uses the 're' module to match user input to a set of predefined patterns. The patterns match specific keywords that indicate the user's intent, such as "add", "subtract", "multiply", and "divide".

When the chatbot detects one of these keywords in the user's input, it prompts the user to input two operands and then performs the corresponding mathematical operation using the "math_operation" function. The result is then displayed to the user.

In addition to performing calculations, the chatbot can also respond to small talk from the user. It responds to greetings such as "hi", "hello", and "hey", as well as expressions of gratitude such as "thank you" and "thanks".

The chatbot also provides the user with a list of available operations if they request it. The chatbot will continue to run until the user types "exit", at which point the program will terminate with a farewell message.

Below is the screenshot of the output:
